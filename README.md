# HiⅤ [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/isakb/HiV.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/isakb/HiV)

HiⅤ is an HTML 5 Game Library, inspired by the JavaScript game engine
[LycheeJS](https://github.com/martensms/lycheeJS). HiⅤ is trying to be [more
hipsterific with a narrower focus](doc/RATIONALE.md)).

## Name

The Ⅴ is the roman numeral 5, not the letter V. The name may also (in more
formal texts) be referred to as The HipsTerML Ⅴ Game Library. Note: for
practical reasons the Ⅴ is written as V in e.g. URL:s.


# Installation

Clone it, `npm install` it, `npm start` it and figure it out for yourself using
the power of source code inspection.


# License

HiⅤ is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE.txt).
