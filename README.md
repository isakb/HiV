# HiⅤ [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/isakb/HiV.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/isakb/HiV)

HiⅤ is an HTML 5 Game Library, inspired by the JavaScript game engine
[LycheeJS](https://github.com/martensms/lycheeJS). HiⅤ is trying to be [more
hipsterific with a narrower focus](doc/RATIONALE.md)).

## Status

HiⅤ is not yet ready to be used by anyone.


## Name

The Ⅴ is the roman numeral 5, not the letter V. The name may also (in more
formal texts) be referred to as The HipsTerML Ⅴ Game Library. Note: for
practical reasons the Ⅴ is written as V in e.g. URL:s.


# Installation

Clone it, `npm install` it, `npm start` it and figure it out for yourself using
the power of source code inspection.


# Example game

Run `npm run example` to start up a *harp* server and (re)load [the example
game](http://localhost:9000/) in your browser once the server has started.

It is convenient to develop with this server running, since the CoffeeScript,
LESS, and Jade files are served to the browser as if they were JS, CSS, and HTML
files.
