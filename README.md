# HiⅤ

HiⅤ is an HTML 5 Game Library, inspired by the JavaScript game engine
[LycheeJS](https://github.com/martensms/lycheeJS). HiⅤ is trying to be more
hipsterific with a narrower focus. It aims to provide a good library for browser
based games.


# Installation

Clone it, `npm install` it, `npm start` it and figure it out for yourself using
the power of source code inspection.


# The name

The Ⅴ is the roman numeral 5, not the letter V. The name may also (in more
formal texts) be referred to as The HipsTerML Ⅴ Game Library.

Note that for practical reasons the Ⅴ is written as V in URL:s.


# Rationale

## Comparison between HiⅤ and LycheeJS

### HiⅤ

* Is a small HTML 5 game library

* Is written in CoffeeScript

* Uses RequireJS for AMD modules

* Uses Grunt for grunt work such as compilation

* Uses Bower for managing dependencies on other libraries (e.g. Q for promises)

* Tries to do one thing well: HTML5 (Canvas only, for now)


### LycheeJS

* Is an environment-independent JavaScript engine

* Is written in JavaScript

* Has its own module system

* Has its own build tools included

* Has no dependencies on other libraries

* Can do five things well (FTW):

    1. HTML5 Canvas

    2. V8GL

    3. WebGL

    4. Native OpenGL

    5. NodeJS


## Conclusion

HiⅤ is basically the future of programming, now.

If you must have "everything" included in your library then use LycheeJS, but if
you only want a small library that helps you get started with an HTML 5 game,
then HiⅤ might be just what you need!
