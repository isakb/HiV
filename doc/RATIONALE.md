# Rationale

## Comparison between HiⅤ and LycheeJS

### HiⅤ

* Is a small HTML 5 game library

* Is written in CoffeeScript

* Uses RequireJS for AMD modules

* Uses Grunt for grunt work such as compilation

* Uses Bower for managing dependencies on other libraries (e.g. Q for promises)

* Tries to do one thing well: HTML5 (Canvas only, for now)


### LycheeJS

* Is an environment-independent JavaScript engine

* Is written in JavaScript

* Has its own module system

* Has its own build tools included

* Has no dependencies on other libraries

* Can do five things well (FTW):

    1. HTML5 Canvas

    2. V8GL

    3. WebGL

    4. Native OpenGL

    5. NodeJS


## Conclusion

HiⅤ is basically the future of programming, now.

If you must have "everything" included in your library then use LycheeJS, but if
you only want a small library that helps you get started with an HTML 5 game,
then HiⅤ might be just what you need!
